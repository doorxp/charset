This subdirectory contains a general character-set conversion
library, used in Timber, and available for use in other software if
it should happen to be useful.

I intend to use this same library in other programs at some future
date. (A cut-down version of it is already in use in some ports of
PuTTY.) It is therefore a _strong_ design goal that this library
should remain perfectly general, and not tied to particulars of
Timber. It must not reference any code outside its own subdirectory;
it should not have Timber-specific helper routines added to it
unless they can be documented in a general manner which might make
them useful in other circumstances as well.

There are some multibyte character encodings which this library does
not currently support. Those that I know of are:

 - Johab. There is no reason why we _shouldn't_ support this, but it
   wasn't immediately necessary at the time I did the initial
   coding. If anyone needs it, it shouldn't be too hard.

 - ISO-2022-JP-1 (RFC 2237), and ISO-2022-JP-2 (RFC 1554). These
   should be even easier if required - we already have the ISO 2022
   machinery in place, and support all the underlying character
   sets.

 - ISO-2022-CN and ISO-2022-CN-EXT (RFC 1922), and EUC-TW. These
   encodings depend on the CNS 11643-1992 character set, and I don't
   know where to find mapping tables between that and Unicode.
   (There is a CNS11643.TXT on unicode.org, but it's CNS 11643-1986,
   which is very different. The 1986 revision contains planes
   numbered 1, 2 and 14, whereas the 1992 one contains planes 1-7.)
   GNU iconv appears to have mapping tables for the 1992 revision,
   but it's under GPL so I can't lift them from there. If anyone
   needs these encodings supporting, they will have to supply a
   source of mapping tables.

 - Big Five Plus, and the Hong Kong extension to Big5. I don't have
   mapping tables for either of these either.
